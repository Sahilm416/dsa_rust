## Scalar Data Types in Rust

Rust provides several scalar data types, which represent single values. These include:

### 1. Integer Types
Rust's integer types come in both signed and unsigned variants. The numbers indicate the number of bits they use.

- **Signed Integers:** Can store both positive and negative values.
  - `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`

- **Unsigned Integers:** Can only store positive values.
  - `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`

### 2. Floating Point Types
Rust supports two types of floating point numbers, which represent numbers with fractional parts.

- `f32`: 32-bit floating point number
- `f64`: 64-bit floating point number

### 3. Boolean Type
A boolean type represents a value that can be either `true` or `false`.

- `true`
- `false`

### 4. Character Type
The `char` type represents a single character. Rust uses the Unicode character set, so it can represent more than just ASCII characters.

- `char`: e.g., 'a', '1', 'ðŸ™‚'
