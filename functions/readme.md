## Functions in rust
Functions in Rust are defined using the `fn` keyword. Here is a simple example of a function :

```rust
fn some_function(){
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
Functions can be of different signatures depending on the parameters and the return type of the respective function.

Note : You don't need to explicitly return something from the function, You can just use expressions and return values like :

```rust
fn gives_five(){
    5
}
```
This already looks so cool!
